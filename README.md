In SAP Retail, the **Material listing** is the operation that links one article to one assortment.

*Definition: An assortment is an SAP Retail object to which materials are assigned (a process known as “listing”).*

**Example:** SAP is used by your Retail Company with a scope including 20 stores named {ST01, ST02, … ST20}. These stores are delivered by Trucks from two Distribution Centers (DC) named {WH01, WH02}.

> Scenario — you want to buy a new reference (SAP Code: 145654789) that will be delivered by the supplier in WH02 and only sold in ST04.

#### Listing Process
- Listing 145654789 in WH02: this reference can be received in this DC
- Listing 145654789 in ST04: this reference can be received and sold in ST04
